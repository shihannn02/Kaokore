### Kaokaore - CNN Classification Project

This project utilizes Kaokore, a modern Japanese art-inspired facial expression dataset. The primary focus is to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify **genders and **identities based on the dataset.

The dataset used in this project is the Kaokore v1.0 version, consisting of 5,552 images. Kaokore is derived from traditional Japanese artwork and is designed to explore facial expression recognition in historical and artistic contexts.

For more details about the Kaokore dataset, refer to the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08595).

The Kaokore dataset includes four versions. This project specifically uses v1.0, which balances artistic variety and data consistency.
